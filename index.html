      <p> My name is Emma Weber and I am an aspiring
        Web Developer. I am
        currently in a 12 week full stack, full-time
        coding boot camp at
        the University of Denver. After a few years
        working for a start
        up in downtown Denver I've decided to change
        career paths and
        challenge myself to try something new! My
        interest in coding was
        sparked by a project I worked on with the
        Eng team in my most
        recent position--the colors, the layering,
        the ability to build
        something with creativity and skill, all
        caught my attention.
        <br>
        <br>
        So here we are, a look into my portfolio. A
        WIP to say the
        least,
        but I'm proud of what I've learned so far
        and am excited to keep
        progressing!
        <br>
        <br>
        A few fun facts about me:
        <ul>
          <li>Native to Colorado but spent time in
            Texas and
            Washington</li>
          <li>Go-to karaoke song is Money Maker by
            Ludacris</li>
          <li>One favorite activity of mine is
            spending 4 hours making
            homemade cinnamon rolls</li>
          <li>Belief that a good, 6oz cappuccino
            is the true sign of
            great coffee shop</li>
        </ul>
